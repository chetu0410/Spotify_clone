# spotify_clone
A Spotify clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would require a combination of front-end and back-end programming to create a music streaming service similar to Spotify. Here is a brief summary of the different components that would be involved:

Front-End:

HTML: This markup language would be used to create the structure of the website, including the layout and content.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets would be used to style the website, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
JavaScript: This programming language would be used to add interactivity to the website, such as creating playlists, searching for songs, and playing music.
